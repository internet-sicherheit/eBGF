Companies and corporations define a governance for their IT systems. This governance is used to manage risks, maintain security and quality of the systems, and improve the performance of the systems and organisations, alike. For corporate IT, governance models have been formalized and standardized in frameworks such as ISO/IEC 38500:2015, ISO/IEC 20000, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27017 or Trusted Cloud Data Protection Profile (TCDP), each capturing different aspects of IT governance. But while traditional IT systems can be controlled and governed by one or more individual organisations, decentralized systems, such as blockchain networks or other distributed ledger technologies (DLT), require a special kind of understanding, agreement or consensus among multiple participants to achieve coordination and collaboration for a specific purpose in order to achieve a common goal. A novel technology like blockchain or DLT creates new challenges to established governance frameworks, but it also allows to apply known solutions to new regulatory requirements. Overview of the eBGF Depending on the principle set-up of a blockchain network \u2013 whether we are speaking of public-permissionless, private-permissioned, or public-permissioned, consortial blockchain networks \u2013 different topics of blockchain governance may come into play and interact with each other quite distinctively on different layers or influence other topics and sections on other layers. The eBGF aims to provide a comprehensive overview about different topics and their relationship, which may help organisations to get familiar with the various aspects of the matter. Different reasons exist for organisations to set up a blockchain network. This motivation needs to be clear and transparent in order to align current and future members to a mission statement, goals and values as well as the scope of the activity. A governance also describes which members may join the consortium \u2013 or why they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t. Members can participate in the network in different roles. The processes for the on- and off--boarding of members need to be defined by the community, and for decisions to be made, a reliable communication and electoral system must be established that offers members the opportunity for participation and co-determination. A blockchain can support different use cases that address and target different user groups. For them, it needs to be easy to use the technology, which implies that the tools and services need to be well documented and provided with simple terms of use. Most relevant is the selection of the network protocol, which include decisions on the consensus algorithm, scalability, security and interoperabiliy of the blockchain. This choice should depend on the use cases and relate to public standards and the best practice activities of the different sectors. In case that a blockchain network is dedicated to a specific purpose or serves a certain use case in a specific industry, the community might have very different requirements for a blockchain network and the way how users of applications based on the network can interact with applications that connect to the network. The economic models of fees and incentives create a token economy which is another fundamental and highly sensitive component of any blockchain governance. The way how the consortium will issue and utilise tokens may touch financial regulation and have a significant impact on the perception of integrity and trust of the whole network. Token economics have to be done right! No other aspect of a blockchain network will face more severe consequences for members of a consortium if done wrong, and the regulation of crypto assets in an international settings is only one of the issues to be taken into account. Token economics require transparency as the guiding principle! Many other components of a blockchain governance refer to a very heterogeneous and rapidly evolving landscape of international regulation, laws, policies, and the liabilities that can be encountered in this landscape can be challenging for organisations to oversee. Regulatory issues need to be openly and transparently addressed in order not to transition projects into a legal grey area. Consortium blockchains are operated by publicly identifiable legal entities. Ignoring regulatory issues at stake is not an option for public-permissioned blockchain networks, that are operated by a consortium of possibly known and established organizations. Different paths to create a governance whitepaper The eBGF will support the process of finding the right approach for each individual network \u2013 in technical and social regards \u2013 to create their specific governance whitepaper. However, there are a number of possible paths, deriving from different perspectives, that can direct the creation and writing process of a specific governance whitepaper from different angles of the framework. 1) Use cases --> Users --> Ecosystem --> Maintenance --> ... 2) Motivation --> Organisation --> Membership --> Economics --> ... 3) Standards --> Protocol --> Maintenance --> ... 4) Protocol --> Economics --> ... 5) Regulation --> Use Cases --> ... 6) Regulation --> Ecosystem, Maintenance --> Membership --> Economics --> Collaboration Bibliography of selected references \u2018ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018\u2019. n.d.

Motivation There are different types of blockchain networks. permissioned permissionless public EnergyWeb, bloxberg, Sovrin Bitcoin, Ethereum private Hyperledger Fabric n/a Usually, the following permission types are distinguished: 1) Private-permissioned 2) Public-permissioned 3) Public-permissionless Public-permissioned blockchains are networks on which: some or all data on the network is public some or all functions of the network are permissioned some or all functions accessible Examples of what can be public Transaction data Public keys and blockchain addresses Examples of what can be permissionless Setting up a full node to access the network and read transaction (not participating in the consensus) Witness functions (which can strengthen the network) Indexing and publication of transactions and data for discoverability in order to allow the public to read and analyse the network (node interface) Examples of what can be permissioned Validation of transactions / participating in the consensus mechanism Deploying smart contracts to use for business application (only specific addresses may deploy them) Opening namespaces or streams Elaboration Consortial blockchains can be defined as: public-permissioned blockchain networks consortial blockchains provide a transparent network and community governance are institutionalised by a set of entities \u2013 which can be companies, organizations or governments that participate in various roles with different attributes and rights in the network consortial blockchains are dedicated to a specific purpose in order to achieve a common goal Advantages of consortial blockchains The advantages of consortial blockchains are: Scalability \u2013 The throughput of transactions can be much higher than with public-permissionless blockchains. Sustainability \u2013 While currently, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other public-permissionless blockchains rely on energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms, consortial blockchains can afford to use alternative, less-secure, \u201cgreen\u201d validation algorithms, such as proof-of-authority (PoA) to reach consensus among nodes that are identifiably and known to the members. Transaction costs \u2013 Using a blockchain that is in control of the consortium allows to regulate or entirely avoid potentially high transaction costs. Regulatory compliance \u2013 Being able to define a membership governance according to the regulatory requirements of a specific industry sector, allows to be regulatorily compliant and be aware of potential legal liabilities. Furthermore, a stronger control can help to limit or avoid illegal activities on the network. Flexibility \u2013 As the members are in control of the nodes, network development and updates can be done much faster (given that there is a certain investment in development of the underlying open-source technologies) and more flexible with a focus on the need of the individual industry sector. Requirement for a network governance A consortial blockchain network strikes a compromise between the highly decentralized public-permissionless blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum \u2013 which pay their trustless operation model with high energy usage \u2013 and classic IT systems, which often aren\u2019t engineered to be run by a set of different organisations. However, since blockchain is a relatively new and highly complicated technology, sometimes the trick lies in the detail. It might not be easy for all industries to get acquainted with the idea of setting up and maintaining a permissioned blockchain. While it's true, that in theory the network can be adapted to the needs of the consortium, in practice it requires a comparably high investment into the underlying technology, both in order to understand capabilities and limitations, but also to perform actual changes to the code base or updates in order to be compatible in the future. Furthermore, running a consortial blockchain requires a committment to actively participate in the governing and developing communities of the consortium.

This motivation needs to be transparent and evident in order to align current and future members with the scope of the activity, the mission statement as well as the goals and values values the activities of the consortium will be based on. Motivation Blockchain is a relatively new and highly complicated technology, sometimes the trick lies in the detail. It might not be as easy for all industries alike to set up and maintain a blockchain network. While it's true, that in theory any blockchain network can be adapted to the needs of the consortium, in practice it might not make sense. It also requires a comparably high investment to understand and master the underlying technology in order to be fully aware of its capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, running a consortial blockchain requires a committment from members to actively participate in the communities of the consortium. Elaboration 1) In order to successfully run a blockchain network, members of the consortium need to analyse and understand the benefits of setting-up a consortium and the reasons to choose the technology. Also, the scope and the purpose of the blockchain network should be defined. 2) The goals and values of the consortium should be publicly documented as this will create trust in the network and the applications that run on it. 3) All members of a consortium should agree on a principle mission statement. This mission statement should not be changed lightheartedly as it shall provide orientation, stability and guidance to the members of the consortium and interested parties or user groups outside of the inner core of the consortium members.

protocol topic is comprised of the components that bind the network architecture together, ranging from node specifications over consensus algorithms and ledger permissions up to security and scalability considerations. The section will also document protocol updates and maintanence measures as well as externally relevant aspects such the interoperability with other networks. Motivation In order to start and run a fully functional blockchain network the members need to dive into more technical aspects that enable the actual implementation of the system. Considerations on node functionality, how formal compliance requirements are realized, node monitoring as well as node software updates are central to running and mainteining a node. Furthermore, defining the possible spectrum of permissions that are available for the network actors is extremely useful for tailoring the capabilities of the users to the expected requirements. Scalability and security are well known to be mutually exclusive when decentrality is already present (blockchain trilemma), therefore treating both in a comprehensive manner can inform about their benefits and pitfalls. Finally, aspects relating to interoperability with other networks and protocol updates help with utilizing external resources and aid with rolling updates among the netowork members respectively.

Furthermore, defining the possible spectrum of permissions that are available for the network actors is extremely useful for tailoring the capabilities of the users to the expected requirements. Scalability and security are well known to be mutually exclusive when decentrality is already present (blockchain trilemma), therefore treating both in a comprehensive manner can inform about their benefits and pitfalls.

Motivation To operate a blockchain network it is important to know the different node types and classes and how to use them correctly. There are several ways to operate a node. To get an overview of all possible ways. Dividing nodes and members in different types and classes allows one to use design patterns like principle of least privilege or efficient resource handling. Elaboration The following is an overview of the different types and classes of a node (the list is not exhaustive): Types Full Node Stores full blockchain data. Participates in block validation, verifies all blocks and states. All states can be derived from a full node. Serves the network and provides data on request. Light Node Stores the header chain and requests everything else. Can verify the validity of the data against the state roots in the block headers. Useful for low capacity devices. Service Node Todo Forensic/audit/witness Node Todo Validator Node: Relevant for networks that use a validation based consensus (e.g. DASH, Tendermint) Propose and vote on new blocks Different ways exists how to incentivise correct behavior for validator nodes, e.g. Proof of Stake or exclusion from the network Mining node: Relevant for networks that use a Proof of Work based consensus (for consortium changes often in combination with Proof of Stake consensus) Proposes new blocks to the network Needs access to full chain Observer Node: todo Other Node: todo Bootnode: Node that collects and maps addresses of nodes in the blockchain network Serves up to date addresses to new nodes that want to connect to the network Only for address exchange, does not participate in block validation, etc. Static node: Full node with static DNS name or IP address. Classes Depending on the point of view, these types can be further classified. (The following list is not comprehensive and can also be understood as an opinionated view) Technical view: Nodes that keep the full blockchain: Full node Archive node Nodes that keep part of the blockchain: Light node Boot node Nodes that create new blocks Validator nodes Mining nodes Service view: Network support: Boot node Static node Blockchain data provider: Full node Archive node Boot node static node Block production: Validator node Mining node Consumers: Light nodes A drawback: There is too much fragmentation in the types and classes of nodes. There is no standard implementation because most blockchains are designed for a special use case (running dapps for public usage or offering a registry for self sovring identities in public or private networks) but all projects are oriented towards the technology. This makes it very cluttered. Unresolved issue: Standardisation of the types and classes of nodes and the related compatibility of the block chain as a whole. References to best practices, examples The ethereum documentation can serve as an example for the types of nodes. If you want to run your own node, you should understand that there are different types of node that consume data differently. In fact, clients can run 3 different types of node - light, full and archive. There are also options of different sync strategies which enables faster synchronization time. Synchronization refers to how quickly it can get the most up-to-date information on Ethereum's state. Full node Stores full blockchain data. Participates in block validation, verifies all blocks and states. All states can be derived from a full node. Serves the network and provides data on request. Light node Stores the header chain and requests everything else. Can verify the validity of the data against the state roots in the block headers. Useful for low capacity devices, such as embedded devices or mobile phones, which can't afford to store gigabytes of blockchain data. Archive node Stores everything kept in the full node and builds an archive of historical states. Needed if you want to query something like an account balance at block #4,000,000. These data represent units of terabytes which makes archive nodes less attractive for average users but can be handy for services like block explorers, wallet vendors, and chain analytics. Syncing clients in any mode other than archive will result in pruned blockchain data. This means, there is no archive of all historical state but the full node is able to build them on demand. We can look at the Sovrin Steward Technical and Organizational Policies as an example implementation for node classes: A Steward Node: * MUST be available to run as a Validator Node or Observer Node on any of the formal ledgers that make up the Sovrin Network. We can also take a look at the Hyperledger Besu documentation as an example of the use of bootnodes: Using Bootnodes is a method for initially discovering peers. Bootnodes are regular nodes used to discover other nodes. Bootnodes and static nodes are parallel methods for finding peers. Depending on your use case, you can use only bootnodes, only static nodes, or both bootnodes and statics nodes. For example, you run multiple nodes on MainNet (discovery using bootnodes), but want to ensure your nodes are always connected (using static nodes).

Motivation The choice of the consensus algorithm must be carefully evaluated and adapted to the respective situation. The governance model of consortium will massively guide the selection of the consensus algorithm. The consensus protocol defines the technical communication protocol by which the state in the network converges onto a singleton state, by means of creating and appending new blocks. The consensus defines the common up to date state of the system creates new blocks. The security and integrity are based on it. Consensus procedures are a crucial element of any blockchain network as they ensure that certain integrity and security guarantees of these decentralized systems are maintained. Agreement on the consensus and the implications of the chosen protocol is essential because the network has to use one and changing it one a for a running network is potentially expensive. Elaboration Types and Definitions of Consensus Algorithms todo Characteristics of Consensus Algorithms todo Examples for Consensus Algorithms For the trust relationships in a consortial blockchain, the following concepts should be considered for choosing a consensus algorithm: Proof of Authority (PoA) Proof of Importance Byzantine Fault Tolerance Crash Tolerance Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET, only available in Hyperledger Sawtooth on Intel CPU) The following consensus algorithmus are not recommended for public permissioned blockchain networks. Proof of Work is designed to be run in a permissionless network with untrusted participants Proof of Stake (in combination with a PBFT consensus) necessarily requires a native cryptocurrency or token with a significant value Before choosing a consensus algorithm the attack vectors and trust assumptions of the system need to be considered because they imply the level of fault tolerance, i.e. Crash Fault Tolerance vs Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Crash Fault Tolerance protects against potential crashing nodes / nodes that experience frequent downtimes. Byzantine Fault Tolerance protects against dishonest nodes. With this regards, quantifiable criteria for those aspects, should be defined (e.g. BFT with 2n + 1, or <50% faulty nodes). Note that the safety of the network has to be evaluated against performance and costs considerations, while in addition, the acceptable intersection between safety and liveness needs to be defined and understood. For a productive implementation it is recommended to use one of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithms. This is used by Hyperledger Besu, among others. However, the choice of the consensus algorithm must be carefully evaluated and adapted to the respective situation. A further distinction needs to be made between PoA and PBFT. Both families of algorithms are well-suited for permissioned networks. However, there is a trade-off the members need to be aware of: PBFT favors safety, i.e. the instant finality of blocks, whereas PoA algorithms favor liveness, i.e. a stable block time without halts in the case of not reaching the \u2154 majority immediately. In both cases, the number of validators participating in the consensus is limited, either because of the communication complexity (PBFT) or because of the delayed finality (PoA). Should the algorithm be optimized? As a rule of thumb, algorithms relevant for security should never be changed by end users or \u201coptimized\u201d. Instead, the standards defined by experts in the field should always be used. The correct selection of algorithms and their parameters requires deep knowledge of the field, and any deviation from the standard may create risks in other areas the user may not be aware of. Unresolved Issues: Maturity level of consensus algorithm Various attacks can be mitigated by enforcing registered participants. This can be an easy solution for consortium blockchains References to best practices, examples There might be a number of different consensus algorithms, that implement concepts such as PoA: AuRa or IBFT for PoA.

Comparing Proof of Authority consensus protocols Besu implements the Clique and IBFT 2.0 Proof of Authority consensus protocols. Proof of Authority consensus protocols work when participants know each other and there is a level of trust between them. For example, in a permissioned consortium network. Proof of Authority consensus protocols have faster block times and a much greater transaction throughput than the Ethash Proof of Work consensus protocol used on the Ethereum MainNet.

Motivation Write permissions allow to limit the access to the network operation and limit potential security risks. Elaboration The spectrum of writing permissions is composed of various levels: Writing a transaction and writing a block are two types of write permissions. Writing a transaction involves sending information to the network, which may go through a validation process, before it is added to a block in the ledger. The task of validating of a transaction may be included to the set of writing permissions. Any participating member that is not an authority member of the network may write transactions. Writing a block is the task of authority nodes. A write permission can be given for a specific type of transaction if it is supported by the ledger. Transfer transactions and smart contract transactions have different permission types. At one extreme, the amount of write permission can get in conflict with the decentralisation aspect. If only one party has write permission, the data are decentralized, but only one party controls what will be persisted. References to best practices, examples The Hyperledger Indy and the TrustChain blockchains define a bag of rules that can be attached to each participant. Since everyone has access to the source code to run a different type of client (a validator node, an endorser), the writing permission is bound to the identity. The validators that are responsible for the block creation process can validate the transactions and refuse them, if the author of the transaction has not the privilege to create this kind of transaction. In the context of an ethereum blockchain you can differentiate between writing permission for creating a smart contract and writing transactions as a smart contract input. This allows more control over the logic that runs on the blockchain that has been defined in the contract with the customer.

The focus is on EU competition law, but most of the jurisdictions world-wide have similar rules in place. Motivation Competition law principally applies to economic operations, and therefore also to the creation of a blockchain consortium and the operation of a blockchain node by one or more companies. The competition law provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\") aim to protect intra-European trade from restrictions and impediments by means of agreements or abuse of power by companies. Competition law wants to make sure businesses and companies compete fairly with each other. This encourages enterprise and efficiency, creates a wider choice for consumers and helps reduce prices and improve quality. Article 101 (1) TFEU prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition. Art 102 (1) TFEU prohibits any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market in so far as it may affect trade between the Member States. Infringements of European Competition Law may lead to company fines of up to 10% of total worldwide annual group turnover. The fines reflect gravity and duration of the infringement. Infringements of the competition law might also result in damage claims: individuals or companies harmed by competition infringements might bring forward compensation claims in national courts. Elaboration Art. 101 TFEU The operator of a blockchain node must take care that there is no anti-competitive coordination between the members of the blockchain consortium and / or the participants of the blockchain project. Concerns relating to anticompetitive coordination by or through the Blockchain node may mainly arise on two levels: Participants might use the opportunities for contact and cooperation provided by the blockchain operator to form anticompetitive agreements or engage in other forms of anticompetitive collusion among themselves. The blockchain operator itself might take a primary role in coordinating the activities of its members or in facilitating tacit collusion between them. The following agreements, decisions or concerted practices may lead to competition problems: Information exchange: the exchange of confidential business information (e.g. information on prices, license fees, costs, customers, production volumes, etc.) going beyond a strict need-to-know basis. In particular, where the members of the consortium are actual or potential competitors, sufficient safeguards must be implemented in order to avoid any anti-competitive information exchange. This includes contractual compliance obligations (a competition law code of conduct) and technical information barriers. Collective boycotts: members of a blockchain consortium must not agree not to source products from or supply products to certain companies or to foreclose certain companies from the market, for example by refusing access to the blockchain on fair and non-discriminatory terms). Membership rules: where membership in the consortium is a relevant factor for operating on a market, the criteria for membership must be fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory and membership must be open to all interested parties fulfilling the criteria. Standardisation: blockchain projects aiming at creating industry-wide standards must ensure participation in standard-setting is unrestricted, the procedure for adopting the standard in question is transparent, there is no obligation to comply with the standard, and access to the standard is provided on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Art .102 TFEU Where a single blockchain operator has a certain degree of market-power and/or acts as a gatekeeper to certain economic activities. In such case, particular care must be taken that no company is foreclosed from the market. Access to the blockchain should be granted on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Merger Control Merger control regulations on EU-wide and national level set up notification requirements for setting up joint venture business consortia that meet certain thresholds. Depending on the individual terms of the project, blockchain consortia may thus be subject to ex-ante merger control approval(s). This should be analysed in a very early stage of the project, and in particular before concluding a binding agreement.

Moreover, examples are given and explained on how to utilize these procedures for a blockchain network. Motivation KYC and AML are legitimacy checks that are used depending on the purpose of the blockchain network. KYC mechanisms are used to create compliance with laws. Accordingly, the users of the network are to be identified in order to either simply prevent bots or spam or even clearly establish that it is a genuine identity. With a corresponding identity determination, money laundering can also be prevented, for example, when a cryptocurrency is used in the network. Elaboration The KYC process used may vary depending on the confidence level of the identification. At a low-threshold level, for example, social media accounts [1] are sufficient for abuse prevention in the network. For other applications, especially identity-based applications such as a self-sovereign identity network, processes are required that can establish identities on the basis of ID cards or other official documents (with the help of the issuer). When using a currency in the network, identification as well as logging of transactions is required for applicable money laundering laws. KYC vs. AML The terms Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer are often combined together or used interchangeably which is not entirely correct. While both are risk-based approaches to money laundering Anti-Money Laundering is a comprehensive set of processes, regulations and rules that together cohesively combat money laundering, terrorism funding and other financial crimes such as identity fraud. KYC is a process that only identifies and authenticates the customers of financial institutions and other companies based on their perceived risk profile. Financial Action Task Force (FATF) The Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) which is the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog recommends that the risk-based approach to counteracting money-laundering and terrorism-financing also applies to all direct and indirect virtual asset service providers ( VASPs ). (With 200 countries commited to implementing them, the FATF has developed the FATF Recommendations, or FATF Standards. Recommendations of the FATF usually have either already been or will be implemented as a minimum AML/KYC standard by the respective countries and regulators. Although there might be deviations and goldplating FATF recommendations provide a very good overview over the international current AML standards and upcoming developments). Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) According to FATF virtual asset service provider means any natural or legal person who, and as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person: exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies; exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets; transfer of virtual assets; safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets; and participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer\u2019s offer and/or sale of a virtual asset. Depending on their particular financial activities, VASPs include: Virtual Asset exchanges and transfer services; some Virtual Asset wallet providers, such as those that host wallets or maintain custody or control over another natural or legal person\u2019s Virtual Assets, wallet(s), and/or private key(s); providers of financial services relating to the issuance, offer, or sale of a Virtual Asset (such as in an ICO); and other possible business models In order to manage and mitigate the risks emerging from virtual assets, countries should ensure that VASPs are regulated for AML/CFT purposes; licensed or registered and subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the relevant measures; competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a VASP; countries should take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry out VASP activities without the requisite license or registration, and apply appropriate sanctions; countries should ensure that VASPs are subject to adequate regulation and supervision or monitoring for AML/CFT and are effectively implementing the relevant FATF Recommendations, to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks emerging from virtual assets. VASPs should be subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with national AML/CFT requirements. VASPs should be supervised or monitored by a competent authority, which should conduct risk-based supervision or monitoring. FATF Recommendation 10 Specifically, FATF issued in Recommendation 10 that VASPs should design Customer Due Diligence ( CDD ) processes to help them in assessing the AML/CFT risks associated with covered Virtual Asset activities and customers. CDD must be performed in the context of establishing a business relationship or while carrying out occasional transactions for non-customers with a value greater than USD 1,000 or EUR 1,000. CDD comprises identifying the customer and applying a risk-based approach to verifying the customer\u2019s identity using reliable and independent information, data or documentation. where the customer is not a natural person, the customer\u2019s beneficial ownership must be determined. the CDD process also includes understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, where relevant, and obtaining further information in higher risk situations. Ongoing due diligence of the customer relationship must be performed and transactions must be scrutinised. FATF Recommendation 16 Under FATF Recommendation 16 when a VASP conducts a transfer of Virtual Assets on behalf of a customer, it is required to: obtain and hold accurate (i.e. verified for accuracy) originator information, including customer name and wallet address, as well as other data such as physical address, date of birth or other specified alternatives; obtain and hold beneficiary information, specifically the customer name and wallet address; and transmit the originator and beneficiary information to a receiving VASP (or other obliged entity, such as a financial institution), if any. Originator and beneficiary information must be screened to ensure that transactions with designated persons and entities (e.g. those subject to financial sanctions) are identified, reported to competent authorities and subject to freezing measures.

It is focused on European privacy regulation, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Motivation Blockchain is a technology with a high potential for development that raises questions on its compatibility with the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR, however, is a key requisite as non-compliance may result in regulatory action ranging from orders to stop the project to administrative fines that can amount to 20m EUR or 4% of the annual turnover of the relevant members of the consortium. Elaboration To ensure GDPR compliance of a blockchain project, it must first be established whether personal data is stored, processed and/or transferred in the context of the blockchain project. If the answer is 'yes' the project must be able to satisfy compliance requirements both on a technical as well as on a governance level. The GDPR is based on the principle of 'accountability' which requires the relevant (joint) data controller(s), which are the entities that determine the means and purpose of data processing \u2013 to be able to provide sufficient evidence and documentation about GDPR compliance. Key Principles and Concepts of GDPR Key principles and concepts of the GDPR include: The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data, i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); pseudonymous data, which is data that requires additional information in order to be linkable to a data subject, qualifies as personal data, too, but pseudonymity may be considered as a security element. Anonymous data is out of scope of the GDPR. In a blockchain project, anonymization techniques like 'salting' and differential privacy may be used to anonymize data that is stored on-chain. The GDPR differentiates between data controllers as the entities determining means and purpose of data processing, and data processors that act under instructions of a data controller. Data controllers can also be joint data controllers. The different roles result in different compliance obligations. Therefore, it is important to assess the roles of all entities involved in a blockchain project (e.g. users, nodes, miners) and address the compliance requirements associated with the respective role. Governance models need to reflect GDPR requirements and deadlines stipulated by law, and ensure that a mechanism exists that ensures that the consortium is able to comply with external influx such as regulatory action and data subject requests. The GDPR requires all processing of data to be in line with the data protection principles laid down in Art. 5 GDPR, i.e. lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality. (Joint) data controllers need to be able to demonstrate towards a regulator that these principles are observed, which results in the requirement of a comprehensive compliance documentation and data privacy management concept. The processing of personal data always requires a legal basis, the most important of which are contractual necessity, consent and legitimate interest. Where a data processing is based on legitimate interest, the relevant (joint) data controller(s) must carry out and document a legitimate interest assessment. The GDPR is based on the assumption that data can be modified or erased where necessary to comply with legal requirements, such as Article 16 (right to correction) and Article 17 (right to deletion). Thus, GDPR requires (joint) data controllers to be able to satisfy these data subject rights as well as respective regulatory requests, and a blockchain project that involves to processing of personal data needs to consider the implication of these rights early on (e.g. use of zero knowledge proofs, other privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption). The GDPR requires the implementation of appropriate measures to ensure data security. The actual determination of measures is subject to the risks associated with the data processing activity and may entail inter alia encryption (transit and rest), role-based access concepts, and pseudonymization. Where the processing of personal data is considered to carry particular risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the relevant (joint) data controller(s) may be obliged to carry out a comprehensive data privacy impact assessment.

Anonymous data is out of scope of the GDPR. In a blockchain project, anonymization techniques like 'salting' and differential privacy may be used to anonymize data that is stored on-chain. The GDPR differentiates between data controllers as the entities determining means and purpose of data processing, and data processors that act under instructions of a data controller. Data controllers can also be joint data controllers. The different roles result in different compliance obligations. Therefore, it is important to assess the roles of all entities involved in a blockchain project (e.g. users, nodes, miners) and address the compliance requirements associated with the respective role. Governance models need to reflect GDPR requirements and deadlines stipulated by law, and ensure that a mechanism exists that ensures that the consortium is able to comply with external influx such as regulatory action and data subject requests. The GDPR requires all processing of data to be in line with the data protection principles laid down in Art. 5 GDPR, i.e. lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality. (Joint) data controllers need to be able to demonstrate towards a regulator that these principles are observed, which results in the requirement of a comprehensive compliance documentation and data privacy management concept. The processing of personal data always requires a legal basis, the most important of which are contractual necessity, consent and legitimate interest. Where a data processing is based on legitimate interest, the relevant (joint) data controller(s) must carry out and document a legitimate interest assessment. The GDPR is based on the assumption that data can be modified or erased where necessary to comply with legal requirements, such as Article 16 (right to correction) and Article 17 (right to deletion). Thus, GDPR requires (joint) data controllers to be able to satisfy these data subject rights as well as respective regulatory requests, and a blockchain project that involves to processing of personal data needs to consider the implication of these rights early on (e.g. use of zero knowledge proofs, other privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption). The GDPR requires the implementation of appropriate measures to ensure data security. The actual determination of measures is subject to the risks associated with the data processing activity and may entail inter alia encryption (transit and rest), role-based access concepts, and pseudonymization. Where the processing of personal data is considered to carry particular risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the relevant (joint) data controller(s) may be obliged to carry out a comprehensive data privacy impact assessment.","title":"Key Principles and Concepts of GDPR"},{"location":"framework/3-regulation/RFC-0331/#internal-references-and-dependencies","text":"( Lists of internal references and dependencies )","title":"Internal references and dependencies"},{"location":"framework/3-regulation/RFC-0331/#references-to-best-practice-examples","text":"( List of references to best practice, examples )","title":"References to best practice, examples"},{"location":"framework/3-regulation/RFC-0331/#bibliography-of-selected-references","text":"Blockchain: legal and regulatory guidance report', The Law Society/Tech London Advocates. 2020.

Motivation Within the last decade cryptocurrencies spreaded from all around the world and grew to an ubiquitous topic, leading authorities to adapt regulations and adapt to the patterns that emerged among the cryptocurrencies. In Germany, crypto currencies have been extensively regulated in the meantime, inter alia by guidance notes issued by the Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungen \u2013 BaFin ). Elaboration Cryptocurrencies are not defined under German financial or regulatory law. BaFin currently distinguishes between the following types of token in order to determine whether or not they constitute financial instruments under the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz \u2013 KWG ), securities under the Prospectus Regulation or the WpPG and/or capital investments under the Capital Investment Act ( Verm\u00f6gensanlagengesetz \u2013 VermAnlG ) triggering an obligation to prepare a prospectus or information sheet under the Prospectus Regulation/WpPG or the VermAnlG. Depending on the categorisation of the token and the connected activities potential authorisation requirements under the Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz \u2013 KWG ), the Payment Services Supervision Act ( Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz \u2013 ZAG ) or the Investment Code ( Kapitalanlagegesetzbuch \u2013 KAGB ) Different Tokens Utility tokens : crypto tokens that give access to certain services or products, similar to an admission ticket or a voucher. The majority of previously known crypto tokens issued in an ICO in Germany belonged to this category. As a general principle, utility tokens do not constitute securities or capital investment. In many cases, tokens like this are also not financial instruments under the KWG. Payment tokens (also known as virtual currencies): structured similarly to bitcoin, the provider generally intends the tokens to be used as an alternative means of payment. As a general rule, payment tokens do not constitute securities or investment products, but they are normally classified as financial instruments under the KWG. Security tokens (also known as equity tokens, investment tokens or asset tokens): holders of this sort of token have membership rights or contractual claims on assets that are comparable with those of a shareholder or bondholder (e.g. claims to dividend-style payments, voting rights, repayment claims, interest payments). Security tokens generally constitute securities within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation and the Securities Trading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz \u2013 WpHG ), and are also financial instruments under the KWG. Crypto Assets : The German implementing law of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive has introduced the term crypto asset as an additional type of financial instrument within the KWG which is defined as a digital representation of an asset which has not been issued or guaranteed by any central bank or public authority and which does not have the legal status of a currency or money, but which is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange or payment on the basis of an agreement or actual practice, or or which serves investment purposes, and which can be transferred, stored and traded electronically\u2019 and which can include tokens as described above. Cryptocustody Business German law requires entities engaging in \u2018cryptocustody business\u2019 \u2013 defined as the business of safekeeping, administration and safeguarding crypto-assets or private cryptographic keys that serve to hold, store or transfer crypto-assets\u2019 to have the appropriate license as a financial services institution to operate. Custodian wallet providers active in Germany must apply to be licensed as a \u2018cryptocustody business\u2019. Once licensed, they are subject to the ongoing prudential supervision of BaFin.

In particular, this presentation focuses on regulatory requirements that are necessary for secure and trustworthy implementation as well as subsequent operation. To this end, the relevant RFCs are based primarily on applicable national and international regulations in the areas of digital services and marketplaces, data protection, know your customer, anti-money laundering, antitrust law and copyright law. Of course, this chapter cannot cover every topic exhaustively, especially since there are additional specific regulatory requirements depending on the purpose and use cases of the network. Motivation The growing digitalization of society and economy has created a system with a limited array of large platforms emerging from it that act as private rule-makers or gatekeepers. This situation is indesirable for an open and free ecnonomy as it results in unfair conditions for other market participants, be it businesses or consumers. Thus following, a basic ruleset needs to be applied to platforms in order to even the market conditions as well as enable secure and trustworthy interactions.

Motivation Clearly defined criteria for eligibility of members will increase security, as well as transparency within the community and parties that can participate in the blockchain network. Moreover, they can increase trust within the network, especially in the beginning, when a decentralized network is more prone to security risks since a malicious member can have a potentially higher impact. Elaboration To ensure eligibility for the consortium, the following criteria must be met and guidelines established: List of eligible organisational forms that can join the consortium. The jurisdiction to which the member must conform. General requirement for organisations/companies to join the consortium. In addition, of course, special cases to allow membership without meeting these requirements. Special requirements for suspended or excluded members who wish to be reinstated.

To apply, an Organization MUST submit a written application to the Sovrin Governing Body responsible for Steward applications as directed on the Sovrin Foundation website.

In this process, privileges must either be suspended for a period of time or withdrawn completely. This means that the member can no longer participate in the decision-making process and, in the case of an exclusion, can no longer access the project infrastructure. This is the only way to ensure that the restrictions take effect and that the infrastructure of the excluded member is no longer integrated into the infrastructure of the blockchain. This ensures that no problems can occur on the network.

These are defined and described below. Motivation In order to be able to implement the structure in the consortium, different roles are required in order to be able to fulfil the authorisations and tasks that one receives as a member. The roles can be used to shape the decision-making process and thus enable targeted weighting. In addition, authorisations can also be granted for tasks. Elaboration The following roles are taken from the Hyperledger Fabrics glossary . These are generally defined and are suitable as an initial orientation for a permission blockchain network. The exact roles required depend on the application area of the respective blockchain. This list of roles is not exhaustive and should be adapted to the respective use case. These descriptions can also be adapted as desired for the respective purpose. Roles Chain Member Entities that do not participate in the validation process of a blockchain network, but help to maintain the integrity of a network. Unlike Chain transactors, chain members maintain a local copy of the ledger. Chain Transactor Entities that have permission to create transactions and query network data. Chain Validator Entities that own a stake of a chain network. Each chain validator has a voice in deciding whether a transaction is valid, therefore chain validators can interrogate all transactions sent to their chain. Chain Auditor Entities with the permission to interrogate transactions. Participants Solution User End users are agnostic about the details of chain networks, they typically initiate transactions on a chain network through applications made available by solutions providers. Roles: None Solution Provider Organizations that develop mobile and/or browser based applications for end (solution) users to access chain networks. Some application owners may also be network owners. Roles: Chain Transactor Network Proprietor Proprietor(s) setup and define the purpose of a chain network. They are the stakeholders of a network. Roles: Chain Transactor, Chain Validator Network Owner Owners are stakeholders of a network that can validate transactions. After a network is first launched, its proprietor (who then becomes an owner) will invite business partners to co-own the network (by assigning them validating nodes).

Motivation At a very early stage, the consortium members should agree on the means of communication and the way they prefer to organize the work and the decision processes. Well-defined processes for collaboration, communication, decision-making, conflict and knowledge sharing are essential for the efficient and smooth operation of the network. The process of setting up the consortial communication infrastructure should start with the definition and an overview of possible tools and services that could be used for the different purposes. Also, the members need to agree on communication policies for the various communication channels. Elaboration The following sections will focus on the topics of: Communication policy Platforms and purposes for consortial communication Decision-making Internal references and dependencies ( Lists of internal references and dependencies ) Bibliography of selected references Albrecht, Simon, Stefan Reichert, Jan Schmid, Jens Str\u00fcker, Dirk Neumann, and Gilbert Fridgen. 2018. \u2018Dynamics of Blockchain Implementation - A Case Study from the Energy Sector\u2019.

Motivation The consortial communications should be based on established practices for good and efficient communication and established standards for conduct. Also, the choice of the tools for communication should be guided by a number of principles, such as inclusiveness, efficiency and standardization. Elaboration Choice of communication tools The choice of the tools of communication should be guided by a number of principles, that allow all members to participate in the collaboration of the consortium in the most inclusive, efficient and standardized way: Inclusion All members need to be able to use all selected tools of communications. For this reason they need to be: - accessible - affordable (free of costs) - open in such a way that they provide no barriers of entry Efficiency All members need to be informed quickly and without efforts to support a good and frictionless collaboration among the members. Standards Members should use tools that are established and broadly used as this increases the chance that many users might already be familiar with the tools and that the tools are well documented. The consortium needs to discuss whether some tools of communication might not be compatible with the corporate communication policies of participating members, privacy or data protection regulations and/or other local regulation. Best practice for good and efficient communication For a good and efficient communication among the members and users, the following principles should be respected: Documentation All communication should be documented professionally and comprehensively, including all relevant details and metadata like e.g. a date of the communication, the involved communication partners. Communication should be documented professionally and comprehensively and transparent in such a way, so that all absent members or new members can informed themselves quickly and efficiently about the communication and matter at stake. All relevant communication should be distributed to all members. All members should be notified, this means that the consortium should establish a way to provide information on updates and communication to all members swiftly. All members should make sure that relevant communication can \u2013 in principle \u2013 can be accessed by all employees of the organization. Rules on debriefing of staff within one organization and internal communication may apply. The members should consequently avoid the that communication and knowledge is dependent on one user (\u201cbus driver problem\u201d) and implement substitute regulations at all times. Transparency Transparency in documentation and decision processes can create mutual trust among the members of the consortium as well as external parties. Reliability Members should be aware of relevant communication and responsive when they are addressed. This means that members should respond in a timely and competent manner. Code of Conduct All members should agree on a code of conduct in their communication that include policies for fair and equal treatment of all members and that allow to resolve potential conflicts efficiently and effectively. The general principles are: - Respect - Ethical behaviour - Principles of efficient dispute resolution - Purpose on focus and scope of the consortium An escalation process needs to be established. This could result in a voting decision about the topic in dispute or the conflict between the members or users. Point of contacts Points of contact for consortial members The consortium should provide relevant information about the consortium and its members, including the information about the roles within the consortium and their contact information. This way, the relevant contacts can be found, e.g. in cases of technical problems with the chain, the need for escalation in case of an emergency, to reach out to expert and decision-making bodies, working admins. Points of contact for external contacts The consortium should provide relevant information about the consortium and its members, and offer a way for interested third parties to get in touch with the consortium, individual members or individual points of contact. It should be clear to interested third parties, who is the responsible contact person for external questions?

For different decisions it might be necessary to use different ways to generate consensus off-chain or on-chain and to define the quorum when a majority is reached, e.g. a qualified majority (when more than half of the votes are sufficient for a decision) or an absolute majority (when a higher majority is required).

In a public permissioned blockchain, it depends on the respective use case whether tokens in whatever form are useful at all. For some use cases, tokens are simply not needed. Motivation When dealing with the economics of blockchain networks, it is particularly important to be clear about which use cases you want to map. Many mechanisms are very important and incredibly useful in public permissionless blockchains. However, since we only have limited and trusted users of the infrastructure through the public permissioned blockchain, some concepts do not make sense at first glance. However, incentives and fees make sense as these mechanisms can be used to finance the infrastructure and ensure that processes run smoothly as they can also be made attractive through incentives. In addition, fees prevent unnecessary actions or spam-like executions. They can also be used to create value that is attractive to the participating members and thus ensure long-term continuity.

They can also be used to create value that is attractive to the participating members and thus ensure long-term continuity.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"framework/7-economics/Economics/#elaboration","text":"The following sections will focus on the topics of: Incentives or Fees Token Economy","title":"Elaboration"},{"location":"framework/7-economics/Economics/#internal-references-and-dependencies","text":"Lists of internal references and dependencies","title":"Internal references and dependencies"},{"location":"framework/7-economics/Economics/#bibliography-of-selected-references","text":"Beck, Roman, Jacob Stenum Czepluch, Nikolaj Lollike, and Simon Malone. 2016. \u2018BLOCKCHAIN \u2013 THE GATEWAY TO TRUST-FREE CRYPTOGRAPHIC TRANSACTIONS\u2019.

A native currency and tokens Incentives and tokens may be necessary for a blockchain network to pay for transaction fees and prevent spamming of the network.

These mechanisms do not have to deal with regulatory issues. The Energy Web Chain is a public permissioned Ethereum blockchain with a native token called Energy Web Token (EWT) listed on exchanges.

Motivation If you come to the conclusion that you want to use tokens, the question naturally arises as to which tokens you can use for which use case. There are a variety of ways to use tokens in a blockchain network. Whether as a reward or as a voting mechanism in which the authorised persons are clearly identifiable. Many things can be realised with tokens. Tokens also provide time-contingent rewards for behaviour. This makes the blockchain network much more effective and efficient to use according to the desired type of use. By creating such values, the effect is also amplified. Therefore, the operation itself becomes more attractive for the members of the consortium. Elaboration To facilitate the decision-making process, a list of all defined token archetypes is provided below. This list was taken from the paper \"To Token or not to Token: Tools for Understanding Blockchain Tokens\" Oliveira et al - 2018. Archetype Main Purposes Description Crypto- Currency (Crypto- Currencies) Currency A token with the ambition to become a widespread digital form of currency. Equity Token (Tokenised Securities) Earnings, Store of Wealth A token which confers to its holder a right to equity-related earnings, such as profitsharing, application rents or platform fees.

Consensus Token (Utility Tokens) Validation Reward, Store-of- Wealth A token which is used as a reward to nodes which ensure data validation and consensus. Work Token (Utility Tokens) Work Reward A token which is used as reward to users who complete certain actions or exhibit certain behaviour. Voting Token (Utility Tokens) Voting Right A token which confers a voting right to its holder. Asset Token (Utility Tokens) Voting Right, Asset Ownership A token which represents asset ownership. Payment Token (Utility Tokens) Payment A token which is used as internal payment method in the application.

Motivation Due to the decentralised architecture of a blockchain network, the data stored on a node is basically secured and not lost in case of a problem. Nonetheless, it can be useful to backup the node data and protect it against misuse. Elaboration Since the blockchain network guarantees by design the replication of data, there is no need to backup the data that is stored on a node. In case of data loss, the node will synchronize all the blocks that are missing from the peer nodes to which it has established a connection. However, it is critical to save pieces of data related to the identity of the operating node. This ensures that, in case of data loss, the node will be again running under the same identity, which is important to the node continuity, its recognition in the network, but also essential to the interaction with smart contracts, which otherwise may not grant it access. This backup procedure includes the following data: node id/enode node keys/keystores related passwords (if at all saved) Furthermore, it is recommended to save all configurations that contribute to the running of the operating node. Such data includes: peer connectivity opened ports mining configuration internal paths For some blockchain technologies changes to the genesis block may need to be backed up. In cases where the ledger data needs to be secured by the network leader (e.g. Iron Throne in the Bloxberg case), then the following aspects should be observed when backing up and restoring data: Saving the node configuration Backup of the node data Time interval for the backup Automation of the backup routine Specify recovery routine Node reintegration procedure Routine for corrupt data Drawback: Due to the decentralised architecture, a backup should actually no longer be necessary and thus causes additional effort.

Unresolved questions: Uniform certified regulations for Blockchain operators. References to best practices, examples We can look at the Sovrin Steward Technical and Organizational Policies as an example implementation: General Security Policies 1. A Steward MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral to maintain protection of all services provided in association with the Sovrin Steward Agreement (\u201cSteward Services\u201d). These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees of the Steward involved with providing the Steward Services. The Steward shall designate its CIO or another officer to provide executive oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision management, employee education, and compliance enforcement. A Steward MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such policies as the Steward deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Steward Services. Because Node administrators are a potential threat vector, a Steward MUST maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment verification requirements for all new hires involved with providing its Steward Services and will extend such requirements to wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing its Steward Services. In accordance with the Steward's internal process and procedures, these requirements MUST be periodically reviewed and include, but may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and additional checks as deemed necessary by the Steward. Each Steward company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring process as applicable and permitted under local law. Employees of a Steward involved with providing its Steward Services MUST complete security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will comply with the Steward's ethical business conduct, confidentiality, security, privacy, and data protection policies. Additional policy and process training MUST be provided to persons granted administrative access to components that are specific to their role within the Steward's operation and support of its Steward Services. If a Steward hosts its Node in its own data center, the Steward\u2019s security policies MUST also adequately address physical security and entry control according to industry best practices. If the Steward hosts its Node using a third-party Hosting Provider, the Steward MUST ensure that the security, privacy, and data protection policies of the Hosting Provider meet the requirements in this document. A Steward MUST make available to the Sovrin Foundation upon request evidence of stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations held by the Steward, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry standards. Node Security Policies A Steward: MUST maintain Steward keys on a separate machine from the machine that runs their node. This machine, called the \u201cCLI (Command Line Interface) system\u201d, uses Steward keys to authorize the Node to participate in the pool, and is thus the basis for trust for the node and the Steward\u2019s identity on the network. The CLI system is not required to have high-end hardware, but in terms of IT best practices for security, it must meet or exceed the standards for the Node (see following items). MUST provide certification that their Node runs in a locked datacenter with appropriate levels of security, including the specifications that they target (e.g., SSAE 16 type II compliance; other standards may also be acceptable). MUST assert that their Node is isolated from internal systems of a Steward (because the Validator Node is publicly visible and thus an inappropriate candidate for access to privileged internal networks). MUST assert that their Node, and its underlying systems, uses state-of-the-art authentication for remote access (at least SSH with key plus password plus source IP firewall rule, and two-factor authentication wherever possible). MUST NOT allow access (remote or local) to the Node or CLI systems by anyone other than assigned admins. MUST apply the latest security patches within one (1) week or less (24 hours or less is recommended). MUST attest that the Node runs on a server protected by a firewall that, at minimum: Disallows public ingress except on ports used by the Node software (different machines may choose to expose ledger features on different ports, so no standard port setup is required). Optionally enables SSH, Remote Desktop, and similar remote access tools but constrains ingress for these tools in some way that excludes the public but allows access for admins. Locks down egress ports to limit the ability to jump from Node to some other location. MUST run the Steward security check tool as requested, and MUST receive TGB approval of the results before the Node is authorized to participate in consensus. MUST run the Steward security check tool from time to time as requested by the TGB and provide the test results report to the TGB within three (3) business days. The emergency concept should handle risks that threat the functionality of the network or components. Therefore, it should cover critical aspects like integrity, authenticity, availability, confidentiality, pseudonymity, decentralization, robustness against abusal, transparency, resource requirements and throughput.

A Steward MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral to maintain protection of all services provided in association with the Sovrin Steward Agreement (\u201cSteward Services\u201d). These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees of the Steward involved with providing the Steward Services. The Steward shall designate its CIO or another officer to provide executive oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision management, employee education, and compliance enforcement. A Steward MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such policies as the Steward deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Steward Services. Because Node administrators are a potential threat vector, a Steward MUST maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment verification requirements for all new hires involved with providing its Steward Services and will extend such requirements to wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing its Steward Services. In accordance with the Steward's internal process and procedures, these requirements MUST be periodically reviewed and include, but may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and additional checks as deemed necessary by the Steward. Each Steward company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring process as applicable and permitted under local law. Employees of a Steward involved with providing its Steward Services MUST complete security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will comply with the Steward's ethical business conduct, confidentiality, security, privacy, and data protection policies. Additional policy and process training MUST be provided to persons granted administrative access to components that are specific to their role within the Steward's operation and support of its Steward Services. If a Steward hosts its Node in its own data center, the Steward\u2019s security policies MUST also adequately address physical security and entry control according to industry best practices.
