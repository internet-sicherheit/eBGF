## The eco Blockchain Governance Framework â€“ eBGF

The eco Blockchain Governance Framework (eBGF) is an initiative to create a framework that will support organisations that have the intention to set up a dedicated public-permissioned, *consortial* blockchain network. 

Creating a governance whitepaper is the most relevant initial task of the consortium. A transparent documentation of the goals and values as well as the technology of the network will enhance the trust in the consortium and the blockchain. And it will improve the reliability and quality of the network, its services and the community in order to operate a professional, production-grade, public-permissioned blockchain.

The eBGF will provide guidelines, recommendations and links to examples, best practice implementations and standards of existing networks and their policies. 

The framework suggests a structure and possible paths for the creation of a specific network governance and possible paths for the actual writing process. However, the eBGF does not offer specific advise for an individual whitepaper. But providing an overview about the topics to address might be a first step towards a governance whitepaper.
