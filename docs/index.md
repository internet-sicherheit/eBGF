## The eco Blockchain Governance Framework – eBGF

The eco Blockchain Governance Framework (eBGF) is an initiative to create a framework that will support organisations that have the intention to set up such a dedicated public-permissioned, *consortial* blockchain network.

The eBGF will offer general experience, considerations, thoughts, questions from experts in all topics. 

it will also provide specific links, recommendations and guidelines to examples, best practice implementations and standards for existing networks and their policies in order to operate a professional, production-grade, public-permissioned blockchain, enhance trust and transparence and improve the reliability and quality of the network, its services and the community.

The framework suggests a structure for the creation of a specific network governance and possible pipelines for the actual writing process.

However, the eBGF does not offer specific advise for an individual whitepaper. But providing an overview about the topics to address might be a first step towards a governance whitepaper.
