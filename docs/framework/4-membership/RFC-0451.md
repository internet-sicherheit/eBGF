# Amicable member exit

## Abstract

This chapter describes the offboarding of members who leave the consortium by mutual agreement.
    
## Motivation

If a member leaves the consortium by mutual agreement, processes must also be in place to ensure that the infrastructure continues to run without problems and that the member leaves. Of course, no sanctions are applied and everything proceeds in an orderly and defined manner. The processes are therefore relatively identical to offboarding, with the exception of sanctions.
