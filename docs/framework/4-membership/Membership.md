# Membership Introduction

## Abstract

The topic of membership shows which criteria have to be fulfilled to become a member and which responsibilities are given through the different roles. It also includes processes to manage membership effectively and easily.
    
## Motivation

Membership confers a higher level of responsibility. In principle, anyone can access the blockchain, but special rights are assigned through membership and the various roles. This makes it possible to obtain certain access rights or to participate in a decision. This creates trust in particular because the members are known and can be held accountable for their behaviour. In addition, access can be restricted or exclusion can be initiated in the event of a breach of duties or violations of regulations. Furthermore, it is also important that members can leave at their own request and that the process as a whole is fully regulated. Only in this way can restrictions be implemented.
