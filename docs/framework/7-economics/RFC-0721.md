# RFC-0721 – Token Economy

## Abstract

In a blockchain network, the token economy can be classified into different archetypes. This makes it possible to assign a token to a specific use case.
    
## Motivation

If you come to the conclusion that you want to use tokens, the question naturally arises as to which tokens you can use for which use case. There are a variety of ways to use tokens in a blockchain network. Whether as a reward or as a voting mechanism in which the authorised persons are clearly identifiable. Many things can be realised with tokens. Tokens also provide time-contingent rewards for behaviour. This makes the blockchain network much more effective and efficient to use according to the desired type of use. By creating such values, the effect is also amplified. Therefore, the operation itself becomes more attractive for the members of the consortium. 
    
## Elaboration

To facilitate the decision-making process, a list of all defined token archetypes is provided below. This list was taken from the paper "To Token or not to Token: Tools for Understanding Blockchain Tokens" Oliveira et al - 2018.

|      Archetype      	|               Main<br>Purposes               	|                                                                                Description                                                                                	|
|:-------------------:	|:--------------------------------------------:	|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| Crypto-<br>Currency 	|                   Currency                   	| A token with the ambition to become a widespread digital form of currency.                                                                                                	|
|   Equity<br>Token   	|        Earnings,<br>Store of<br>Wealth       	| A token which confers to its holder a right to equity-related earnings, such as profitsharing,<br>application rents or platform fees.                                     	|
|   Funding<br>Token  	|        Store of<br>Wealth,<br>Funding        	| A token which is perceived as a long-term investment from the holder’s perspective,<br>and as a financing vehicle for the project’s team and/or the community (bounties). 	|
|  Consensus<br>Token 	| Validation<br>Reward,<br>Store-of-<br>Wealth 	| A token which is used as a reward to nodes which ensure data validation and<br>consensus.                                                                                 	|
|    Work<br>Token    	|                Work<br>Reward                	| A token which is used as reward to users who complete certain actions or exhibit<br>certain behaviour.                                                                    	|
|   Voting<br>Token   	|                Voting<br>Right               	| A token which confers a voting right to its holder.                                                                                                                       	|
|    Asset<br>Token   	|    Voting<br>Right,<br>Asset<br>Ownership    	| A token which represents asset ownership.                                                                                                                                 	|
|   Payment<br>Token  	|                    Payment                   	| A token which is used as internal payment method in the application.                                                                                                      	|

In the same paper "To Token or not to Token: Tools for Understanding Blockchain Tokens" Oliveira et al. - 2018, a decision tree was developed to identify as easily as possible those tokens that are needed for the corresponding use case. As there is a constant evolution of the token economy, further research is recommended. The following questions were taken from this decision tree. These give a good indication whether one needs a token and which archetype it would be accordingly. If you can answer the questions with the exception of the last one with "yes", a token is recommendable and very likely the right instrument for the application.

- Do you want to create a cryptocurrency (i.e., digital money)?
- Do you want a token as means of distributing equity-related earnings  (profit-sharing, rents or fees)?
- Do you want a token as a means of providing store of wealth tied to the platforms long term value?
- Do you want a token as a means of ensuring funding for the development team or the community? 
- Do you want a token as a means of incentives to ensure distributed consensus? 
- Do you want a token as a means of rewarding user behaviour (apart from distributed consensus)?
- Do you want a token as a means of implementing voting rights?
- Do you want a token as a means of representing an asset (physical, digital or legal)?
- Do you want a token as a means of exchange for internal transactions?
- At least one feature? 
- Can the system function as intended without a token?

This process makes it very easy to obtain the required tokens for the blockchain network. Since there are many use cases and the blockchain network can be very individually designed, the tokens must of course be individually adapted to the respective system.
