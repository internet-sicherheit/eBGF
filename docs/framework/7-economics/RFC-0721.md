# RFC-0721 – Token Economy

## Abstract

In a blockchain network, the token economy can be classified into different archetypes. This makes it possible to assign a token to a specific use case.
    
## Motivation

If you come to the conclusion that you want to use tokens, the question naturally arises as to which tokens you can use for which use case. There are a variety of ways to use tokens in a blockchain network. Whether as a reward or as a voting mechanism in which the authorised persons are clearly identifiable. Many things can be realised with tokens. Tokens also provide time-contingent rewards for behaviour. This makes the blockchain network much more effective and efficient to use according to the desired type of use. By creating such values, the effect is also amplified. Therefore, the operation itself becomes more attractive for the members of the consortium. 
    
## Elaboration

To facilitate the decision-making process, a list of all defined token archetypes is provided below. This list was taken from the paper "To Token or not to Token: Tools for Understanding Blockchain Tokens" Oliveira et al - 2018.

In the same paper "To Token or not to Token: Tools for Understanding Blockchain Tokens" Oliveira et al. - 2018, a decision tree was developed to identify as easily as possible those tokens that are needed for the corresponding use case. As there is a constant evolution of the token economy, further research is recommended. The following image was taken from the paper. These give a good indication whether one needs a token and which archetype it would be accordingly. If you can answer the questions with the exception of the last one with "yes", a token is recommendable and very likely the right instrument for the application.

This process makes it very easy to obtain the required tokens for the blockchain network. Since there are many use cases and the blockchain network can be very individually designed, the tokens must of course be individually adapted to the respective system.
