# Developers

## Abstract

This document specifies summarizes essential knowledge, best practices and requirements an app developer should know in order to  create working apps on a blockchain Network. Furthermore, this document gives a rough guideline on how to develop a decentralized app.
    
## Motivation

Every blockchain network is meant to pursue specific goals and includes people or organizations that operate within the network to achieve these goals. Therefore, a network operates one or more applications that serve to achieve its goals. Last but not least, these applications also include services or transactions to which a business model can be linked in order to either make a profit or ensure the continued operation of the network.
    
## Elaboration

### Guideline

1. Define the idea or concept
2. Research for competition
3. Analyze options
4. Choose or develop a platform (e. g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, Ripple, etc.)
5. Development Process
6. Deployment and Maintenance

### DApp Integration

Best practices on how to integrate DApps into a business model or processes.
