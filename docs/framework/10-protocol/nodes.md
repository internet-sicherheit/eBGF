#  Nodes Introduction

## Abstract

The node subsection is designed to provide an in-depth overview of the node protocol. This includes RFCs dealing with node classes and their scope, node compliance verification, node monitoring, node protocol updates, and node backup and restore procedures.

## Motivation

Nodes are the central elements of operation and communication in a blockchain network. Establishing the appropriate scope and functionality of the members' nodes, as well as managing their operation in the network is critical to the well-functioning of the blockchain as a whole.

To begin with, identifying the types of nodes that the members want to adopt gives a clear indication of the resource allocation. Nodes need to meet certain requirements, both on the hardware- and service levels. Verifying that these requirements are fulfilled at any given time and automatizing the procedure is an objective of the network.

For the network members themselves, managing a node means following the guidelines that the network has set up, which includes updating the protocol and of the related software. Further considerations on backing up and restore options of node keys deserve to be mentioned and are included in the containing RFCs.
