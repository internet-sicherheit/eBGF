#  Nodes Introduction

## Abstract

The node subsection is designed to provide an in-depth overview of the node protocol. This includes RFCs dealing with node classes and their scope and node compliance verification.

## Motivation

Nodes are the central elements of operation and communication in a blockchain network. Establishing the appropriate scope and functionality of the members' nodes, as well as managing their operation in the network is critical to the well-functioning of the blockchain as a whole.

Identifying the types of nodes that the members want to adopt gives a clear indication of the resource allocation. Nodes need to meet certain requirements, both on the hardware- and service levels. Verifying that these requirements are fulfilled at any given time and automatizing the procedure is an objective of the network.
