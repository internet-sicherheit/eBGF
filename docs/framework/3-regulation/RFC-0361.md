# Cryptocurrencies

## Abstract

This RFC addresses the legal status of cryptocurrencies in various jurisdictions and how they should be treated in the context of financial or tax law.
    
## Motivation

Within the last decade cryptocurrencies spreaded from all around the world and grew to an ubiquitous topic, leading authorities to adapt regulations and adapt to the the patterns that emerged among the cryptocurrencies. The regional or national differences must be particularly taken into account here, as cryptocurrencies are treated differently under tax law, among other things.
    
## Elaboration

The report on Regulation of Cryptocurrency Around the World includes an international look at cryptocurrencies and what their legal status is in different regions or countries. Among other things, it highlights how cryptocurrencies are treated under tax law or whether they are allowed at all in the respective applicable jurisdiction.
