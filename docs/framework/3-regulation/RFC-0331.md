# Data Privacy (GDPR)

## Abstract

This RFC covers the different aspects of data privacy that needs to be considered for blockchain-networks and potential goals that have special reqirements to it, e. g. enabling a cryptocurrency based marketplace or providing a SSI solution. Moreover it discusses blockchain networks in the context of the basic principles of the GDPR and, therefore, how to achieve transparency, data minimization, purpose limitation and so on.
    
## Motivation

Data Privacy is a key element of the regulation once personal data is processed within a network, e. g. for financial transactions or in the context of SSI. Therefore, the network needs a well-structured concept, that organizes data protection logically and technically in order to operate the network in an organized and lawful manner.
