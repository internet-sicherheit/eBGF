# Copyright (DSM)

## Abstract

The following text discusses the copyright requirements for a blockchain network. In particular, the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (DSM) is taken into account and topics such as licensing obligations and upload filters are addressed.
    
## Motivation

Regardless of the objectives of the blockchain network, it may be that content is located or processed on the network that is protected by copyright or must be protected accordingly. Even more so, due to the legal amendment of copyright law with the Directive on Copyright in Digital Single Markets, it may even be necessary to take organisational and technical measures even before data is fed into the network.
