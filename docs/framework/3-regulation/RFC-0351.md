# Services (DSA)

## Abstract

This document presents what needs to be considered for regulation and implementation with regard to the provision as well as the operation of digital services. Particular attention is paid to the core aspects of the legislative initiatives DSA (Digital Services Act) and DMA (Digital Markets Act) to ensure that platforms do not become gatekeepers and damage the digital economy. For the platforms or networks themselves, precautions must be taken to exclude trade in illegal goods or services and to prevent the dissemination of misinformation.
    
## Motivation

When establishing a Blockchain-network there is a high chance for it being a platform for one or more digital services, for example to share digital contents. However, a network must define rules and operate an enforcement system to ensure that the network or platform cannot be misused for various destructive or illegal purposes.
