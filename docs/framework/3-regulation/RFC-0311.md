# Antitrust

## Abstract

This RFC discusses various topics with respect to antitrust law that also impact other topics or chapters in the Governance Framework. Standardization efforts, access rights to the blockchain, information exchange and collusion risk and merger control are particularly focused on here, as there are various potentials for error and abuse.
    
## Motivation

Public blockchain networks are already in a large competitive environment, which continues to grow and gain importance in the context of digitalization. Therefore, it is necessary to take a closer look at antitrust issues in order not to risk long-term investigations, fines or even criminal measures.
