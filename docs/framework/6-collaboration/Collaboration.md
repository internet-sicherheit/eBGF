# Collaboration Introduction

## Abstract

The topic of collaboration focuses on the communication policies as well as on the means of communication among the consortium members.
    
## Motivation

At a very early stage, the consortium members should agree on the means of communication and the way they prefer to organize the work and the decision processes. 

Well-defined processes for collaboration, communication, decision-making, conflict and knowledge sharing are essential for the efficient and smooth operation of the network. 

The process of setting up the consortial communication infrastructure should start with the definition and an overview of possible tools and services that could be used for the different purposes. 

Also, the members need to agree on communication policies for the various communication channels.   
    
## Elaboration

The following sections will focus on the topics of:

- Communication policy
- Platforms and purposes for consortial communication
- Decision-making
