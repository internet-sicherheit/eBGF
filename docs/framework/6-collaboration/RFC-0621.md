# Consortial Communication

## Abstract

Processes and tools for efficient and effective communication in the consortium  

## Motivation

For good communication, it is particularly important that all members are on the same level. Therefore, an infrastructure is needed in which everything is neatly documented and freely accessible. Work processes should be documented as well as the corresponding contact persons and their representatives. This ensures that communication can take place smoothly at all times. This must be possible beyond organisational boundaries. Consequently, the communication applications used must also cover and fulfil the guidelines of all participating organisations. Communication can create a sense of community that leads to better cooperation among all participants and benefits the project immensely. For these reasons, communication is so important and contributes to long-term success.
