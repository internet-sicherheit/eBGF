# Scope

## Abstract

This section will consider the scope of the network and the reasons why a consortium might want to consider using blockchain technology to achieve their goals.

## Motivation

 In order to successfully run a blockchain network, members of the consortium need to understand what they are doing and why they chose to do it in such a specific way. 
 
 So as a first step, the scope and the purpose of the blockchain network should be defined. 
 
 What are the functions of blockchain? What does it do? Why use this technology in favour of established IT solutions? Are there existing solutions that might solve the problems that the consortium wants to address in a less challenging way?
