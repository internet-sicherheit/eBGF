# Assessment

## Abstract

This section will consider the assessment process of creating a blockchain consortium, the reasons why a consortium might want to consider using blockchain technology to achieve its goals and the scope of the network.

## Motivation

 In order to successfully run a blockchain network, members of the consortium need to analyse and understand the benefits of setting-up a consortium and the reasons to choose the technology. Also, the scope and the purpose of the blockchain network should be defined.
 
 What are the functions of blockchain? What does it do? Why use this technology in favour of established IT solutions? Are there existing solutions that might solve the problems that the consortium wants to address in a less challenging way?
 
## Elaboration

1) Setting up a blockchain consortium   
2) Using blockchain technology
