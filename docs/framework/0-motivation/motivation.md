# Motivation Introduction

## Abstract

Different reasons exist for organisations to set up a dedicated blockchain network. This motivation needs to be transparent and evident in order to align current and future members with the scope of the activity, the mission statement as well as the goals and values values the activities of the consortium will be based on.

## Motivation

 Blockchain is a relatively new and highly complicated technology, sometimes the trick lies in the detail. It might not be as easy for all industries to set up and maintain a blockchain network. 
 
 While it's true, that in theory the network can be adapted to the needs of the consortium, in practice it requires a comparably high investment to master the underlying technology in order to understand capabilities and limitations, but also to perform actual changes to the code base or updates in order to be compatible in the future. Furthermore, running a consortial blockchain requires a committment from members to actively participate in the governing and developing communities of the consortium.
 
    
## Elaboration

1) In order to successfully run a blockchain network, members of the consortium need to understand what they are doing and why they chose to do it in a specific way. So as a first step, the **scope** and purpose of the blockchain network should be defined. What is the task of the blockchain? Why use this technology in favor of established IT? Are there existing solutions that might solve the problems that the consortium wants to address in a less challenging way? 

2) All potential members of a consortium should agree on a principle mission statement. This fundamental mission statement should be changed lightheartedly or easily as it shall provide orientation, stability and guidance to the members of the consortium and interested parties or user groups outside of the inner core of the consortium members.
