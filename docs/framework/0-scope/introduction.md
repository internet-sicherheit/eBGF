# Introduction to the scope of the eco Blockchain Governance Framework

## Governance for decentralised systems

Governance models describe systems of control and regulation for political and social entities as well as organisations. Companies and corporations define a governance for their IT systems. This governance is used to manage risks, maintain security and quality of the systems, and improve the performance of the systems and organisations, alike.

For corporate IT, governance models have been formalized and standardized in frameworks such as ISO/IEC 38500:2015, ISO/IEC 20000, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27017 or Trusted Cloud Data Protection Profile (TCDP), each capturing different aspects of IT governance. But while traditional IT systems can be controlled and governed by one or more individual organisations, decentralized systems, such as blockchain networks or other distributed ledger technologies (DLT), require a special kind of understanding, agreement or consensus among multiple participants to achieve coordination and collaboration for a specific purpose in order to achieve a common goal. A novel technology like blockchain or DLT creates new challenges to established governance frameworks, but it also allows to apply known solutions to new regulatory requirements.

## Overview of the eBGF

Depending on the principle set-up of a blockchain network – whether we are speaking of public-permissionless, private-permissioned, or public-permissioned, *consortial blockchain* networks – different layers and components of governance may come into play and interact with each other quite distinctively.

## Matrix structure

The eBGF will provide a description of a *matrix structure*. This means that each components (or sub-component) on different layers will influence other components (or sub-component) on other layers.

The protocol governance will define the foundational technology and the consensus algorithm, which will have an effect on hardware requirements for validation nodes, maintenance or decisions-making for network updates.

The governance for nodes and validators (or miners) may be defined by the institution that will run the consortium, the collaboration of its members as well as policies to participate in the network, eventually touching the question of sufficient decentralisation.

In case that a blockchain network is dedicated to a specific purpose or serves a certain use case in a specific industry, the community might have very different requirements on a blockchain network and the way how users or customers can interact with applications that connect to the network. 

Also, some industries or sectors might be more experienced with digital innovation or more knowledgeable of technical standards, so that the provided ecosystem, the SDKs, the wikis and documentations need to feature a very different level of specification. 

The economic models of incentives and fees of a token economy is another central and highly sensitive component of any blockchain governance. The way how the consortium will issue and allocate tokens, define models for pre-mining or other benefits will provide the incentives for the members to join the consortium, but the implications of the economics have a significant impact on the perception of integrity and trust of the whole network. 

Token economics have to be done right! No other aspect of a blockchain network will face more severe consequences for members of a consortium if done wrong, and the regulation of crypto assets in an international settings is only one of the rabbit wholes consortia may be trapped in. Token economics require transparency as the principle guiding principle!

Many other components of a blockchain governance refer to a very heterogeneous and rapidly evolving landscape of international regulation, laws, policies, and the liabilities that can be encountered in this landscape can be challenging for organisations to oversee. 

## Strategies for publicly identifiable legal entities

Existing public networks shifted some of the mentioned issues of governance towards the layer of the technical protocol and code-based rules. Other issues simply remained unaddressed and unresolved, thereby transitioning the projects into a legal grey area. 

Both strategies – trying to respond to regulatory issues concerning one specific component by putting the burden to solve this issue on another, or trying to simply ignore issues at stake, are not an option for public-permissioned blockchain networks, that are operated by a consortium of possibly known and established organizations. The fact that publicly identifiable legal entities collaborate to collectively operate a system makes the operators responsible for the system, as well as for activities that occur in this system. 

All too often the governance model of public-permissioned consortium-run blockchain networks lacks the quality which is required to serve the goals and use cases of that particular blockchain network. To improve on this situation we are proposing the eco Blockchain Governance Framework. The eBGF will support the conception and creation of a proper governance for specific individual blockchain consortia in order to operate a professional, production-grade, public-permissioned, consortial blockchain network. 

## The eBGF

The eBGF will serve as an abstract collection of topics that need to be addressed in order to operate a professional, production-grade, public-permissioned blockchain network. 

The eBGF will offer structure, questions, considerations, thoughts, guidelines, links and recommendations for standards and best practices of technical implementations. It will document experiences regarding technical monitoring, hardware and software requirements, policies updates, backup and disaster recovery. It will describe the processes for off- and on-boarding of members into the network as well as proposing and executing changes to the governance itself, and it will address many more aspects.

However, it will not define a specific blockchain governance which defines answers to all issues of any blockchain governance. 

But addressing and locating issues of specific components on distinctive layers alone is a first step to finding solutions and improve the reliability and quality of the network and services. 

Addressing and locating issues of specific components on distinctive layers of a blockchain governance framework will also allow to evaluate and compare different networks protocols and governance models to each other and create greater transparency and trust in the blockchain networks of the future.
