## RFCs


### Definition of RFCs

``What are RFCs?``

RFCs (Request for Comments) are usually being used as a text format for [technical documents and standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments). 

For the eBGF we have adapted the original concept of RFCs for our purposes. In our context, RFCs are defined as text documents with a given structure, that will support collaborative writing on specific topics. You can think of RFCs as a form. 

### Naming of RFCs

``How are RFCs named and numbered?``

New RFCs are named according to the topic, the number fitting the category. 
Any new RFC gets a 4 digit number, the first two digits define the category, the third digit the subcategory and the fourth digit the place in the sequence of documents within a subcategory. The name of the document should be short, distinct and recognizable.

*Please be sure to edit the mkdocs.yaml file once you create, delete or rename a document.*

*Also note if a document has no '# Title' the yaml file defines the title on the website, the navigation stays untouched by the markdown files.*

### Structure of RFCs

``How are RFCs structured?``

1.  **Abstract**

	(*1-2 sentences*)
    
2.  **Content** **

	(*max. +- 2.000 characters, former “motivation” section*) 
    
3.  **Elaboration** **

	(*max. +- 5.000 characters*)

5. **References to best practice, examples**  

	(*List of references to best practice, examples*)

*Please note that this structure might be due to changes in the process of the work and the progress of the writing.*
